Quantitative Computational Mathematics Using C++


Many different mathematic classes and equations to compute values for many different scenarios.


This includes calculations of derivatives, equities, and bonds. 


Some equations implemented are the Black-Scholes Model, Monte Carlo Calculations, and many more.
